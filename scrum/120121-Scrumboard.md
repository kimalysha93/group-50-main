1. What is the branch they worked on

- S669-Backend-Testing

2. What is the progress so far (at least some test cases written/some results/code available)

- Implemented all of the backend requirements testing, and updated a couple minor changes in the repo.

3. Any difficulties

- Some backend functionality code had to be modified for quantity testing. Otherwise, most of my difficulties were from forgetting that product titles need to be alphanumeric.

4. What is the plan for the days before the deadline

- Wait for the front-end development & testing to be completed (to ensure the front-end is working as intended), and then begin on security testing (SQL Injection prevention).
