# Repository for CISC-327 Group 50 Project

This repository has been reuploaded from my old GitHub account that is no longer in use. The purpose of this project is to use Python Selenium automation and SQL queries to test the Front-End and Back-End of a web application. The tasks for this project were equally delegated; all development, testing, and code reviews were done by 4 team members.
